## Goal

Solve the merchants guide problem the way I would like it, in Rust.
Try to be as idiomatic as possible, and consider the answer the main user
value to provide. Thus that and only that MUST be tested, anything else 
is 'extra', like actually testing for a few things the user can run into.

## TODO

* [x] show correct answers
* [ ] run clippy
* [ ] docker-build-env-interactive
